This project is an experiment. I do not claim it is the best solution
for anyone for any purpose. It may well turn out to be nothing more than a pointless weekend
project that familiarizes me with some of the underlying technology.

Constraints:

- **Zero overhead for someone that wants to use the information.** 
Once you clone the repo, or otherwise obtain all of the files, all you 
have to do is load the html file in the browser. The only dependencies
allowed are Javascript files in the same directory and CDN libraries.
These are allowed since they do not require any action on the part of the user.
Notably, this rules out running a web server, the use of a database,
processing content, or installing scripts/programs.
- **Realistic content entry.** You do not have to write html. You don't have
to write in plain text. Markdown format is a natural fit for this requirement,
because it's well known and does most of what we need. There has to be
math support, since that is a common requirement.
- **It has to be possible to perform real database queries on the content.**
I'm using PouchDB as an in-memory database. Querying the DOM can take you
quite far. However, it's not always intuitive, and it has some limitations.
PouchDB allows for the use of mango queries, similar to MongoDB.

At this point, the questions are "What would something meeting these constraints
look like?" and "How well does it scale?" I think the advantages of running
a web server will outweigh the advantages of having a single html file,
but I want to give it a real-world test. I have no idea at this point how
user-friendly and efficient a system meeting these constraints can be.

Advantages:

- Low overhead. You can return to it in five years and you will not have
to refresh your memory about anything. Simply load the file in the browser.
Want to share it with someone else? Give them the files and tell them to
open the .html file in the browser. They can use the queries you've set up
for them.
- You have a full database at your disposal.
- The simplicity of the OBTF system, but with the ability to query.
- You're in charge of the data. You can sync with Git, Dropbox, USB drive,
or however you choose. It's nothing but a text file. You have a database
without the problems of backups and syncing.
- The use of a real in-memory database means that even complicated queries 
can be very fast.

Disadvantages:

- Heavy on the dependencies. It loads PouchDB, the PouchDB in-memory
database adaptor, the PouchDB search adaptor, markdown-it to process the
markdown, markdown-it-katex for math support, and the full katex. Only the
PouchDB libraries are necessary.
- A lot of processing of all of the data on page load. It might be slow
on initial load. It's intended for a high ratio of views and queries to
loads.
- Editing requires a text editor and knowledge of how to use the text
editor to automate things.
- Like the OBTF system, it's intended for a workflow where you primarily
input items at the top of the file, and rarely edit anything other than the
first few items. In other words, you "drop stuff in the bucket quickly" while
you're working, and query them if you need them later. It doesn't work so well
for other uses.

This system was inspired by the OBTF (one big text file system). I would
classify that system as providing the following:

- You enter notes with minimal overhead in a single text file. The primary
goal is to record information easily.
- Most of the time you're recording information *in case* you need it in
the future, rather than editing.
- It's nice to have a timeline of all past activities for things like
revisiting a meeting with someone. It gives you the comfort of a low-cost
archive for all your stuff. You can even track tasks and projects in the
first few lines of the file, which is fine, since you can easily edit
and move things around.

[This is a good example of OBTF.](https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/)

I've tried the OBTF system multiple times. Each time, I eventually moved 
on to something else, in spite of saying "This time I've made the necessary
adjustments to fix the shortcomings that caused it to collapse last time."
Inevitably, I'd end up going deeper and further and tweak this or that,
but it just wouldn't work.

There were two problems that you can't easily address with OBTF:

- You can't query things easily. How do I list all the links on a particular
topic I've dumped into OBTF? How do I see a list of all the things I want to remind
myself to do "someday" that I've recorded in the last six months.
- Editing doesn't happen since you don't return to anything after about
line 100 of the file. Some things should be edited, like noting how you
resolved a problem or that you finished a project and stored it in Github
somewhere.

In short, the system was too limited to work for me. It was a way to dump
things in a file to get them off my mind, but that's not what I'm after.
If you have to use a different system for the cases where OBTF doesn't work,
it kind of defeats the purpose of a minimalist system, since that's anti-minimalist.

This system adds a real database on top of an OBTF-style system. It also
makes it more realistic for long-term usage by allowing for metadata and
markdown formatting. And it makes a *massive* difference if you can
view the OBTF in a browser rather than a text editor. As much as I like
Geany (been using it for years) I would much rather view notes in a
browser.

One final thing that doesn't have much to do with OBTF is that it's
incredibly easy to customize this type of system for almost anything you
want to do. Productivity and notes systems simply do not work for most
of us because customization is so important. The only good productivity
or notes system is the one you write for your specific use case. I think
OBJF does as good a job in that area as any other system I've seen. It's
powerful, yet you have complete control, without even having to know much
to customize it for your uses.
